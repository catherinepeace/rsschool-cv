## Summary

Due to the life-changing circumstances I've decided to switch my career and start to develop my skills in IT. 

Being a doctor as per my education and proficient web applications user as per my former work place I used to deal with huge amount of information that in most cases was not well-structured and well-collected. I've decided to change it and contribute in developing of web applications becoming a Frontend Developer.

I believe that my hardworking skills and great desire to dive deeper into the new industry will help me to gain enough experience to become a good Frontend Engineer.
